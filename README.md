📘 Overview

ParkEase enables two user roles:

Owners: List their available private parking spaces with location and availability details.

Drivers: Search and reserve nearby parking spots in real-time via an interactive map powered by Radar API.

📂 Project Structure

The project follows a three-tier containerized architecture, managed through Docker Compose for seamless orchestration and local development.

Component	Description	Technology Stack	Docker Port
Frontend (parkease-frontend)	Responsive web application with interactive maps and forms.	React 18, Nginx	5190
Backend (parkease-backend)	RESTful API handling user authentication, data management, and search.	Spring Boot 3, Spring Security (JWT)	8080
Database (parkease-db)	Persistent relational database for user and parking data.	MySQL 8	3307
🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites

Docker Desktop
installed and running.

Option 1: Run Using Docker (Recommended)
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Pranjali784/ParkEase_Pro.git
cd ParkEase_Pro

# 2. Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# 3. Update secrets in the .env file
# (e.g., GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID, RADAR_SECRET_KEY, MYSQL_PASSWORD)

# 4. Build and start all services
docker-compose up --build


Once started, the following services will be available:

Service	URL
Frontend Application	http://localhost:5190

Backend API (via Nginx proxy)	http://localhost:5190/api
Database Initialization

The initial database is empty. To populate it with test data:

Open MySQL Workbench or any SQL client.

Connect using the following details:

Key	Value
Hostname	127.0.0.1
Port	3307
Username	parkease_user (as per .env)
Password	MYSQL_PASSWORD from .env
Schema	parkease_db

Run the SQL script located at:

parkease-api/src/main/resources/data.sql

Stopping Services
# Stop all running containers
docker-compose down

# Stop and remove database volumes (clears data)
docker-compose down -v

Option 2: Manual Local Setup (Without Docker)
<details> <summary>Expand for manual setup instructions</summary>
1️⃣ Database Setup

Install MySQL 8 locally (default port: 3306).

Create a database named parkease_db.

Execute data.sql to populate sample users and parking data.

2️⃣ Backend Setup
cd parkease-api
cp src/main/resources/application.properties.example src/main/resources/application.properties
# Fill in DB credentials and API keys
./mvnw spring-boot:run


Backend will be available at: http://localhost:8080

3️⃣ Frontend Setup
cd parkease-frontend
cp ../.env.example .env.local
# Add environment variables (VITE_...)
npm install
npm run dev


Frontend will run at: http://localhost:5190
